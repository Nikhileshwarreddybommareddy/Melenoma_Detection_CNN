# Melenoma Detection Using CNN
Goal: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
      It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma 
      has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- **Background:** The project focuses on melanoma detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not detected and treated early. CNNs have shown promising results in computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma by analyzing skin lesion images.

- **Business Problem:** The business problem addressed by the project is the need for accurate and efficient melanoma detection to aid in early diagnosis. Early detection of melanoma significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. Automated melanoma detection using CNNs can assist dermatologists and healthcare professionals in making more accurate and timely diagnoses, potentially saving lives.

- **Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset of skin lesion images specifically curated for melanoma detection. The dataset consists of images of skin lesions, including both melanoma and 8 other classe of skin cancer. Each image is labeled as either melanoma or nthe respective class to facilitate supervised learning.
